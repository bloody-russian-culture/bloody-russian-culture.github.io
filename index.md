Ever heard of the "Great" Russian culture?
Ever wondered what makes it so great?
The answer is __Imperialism__.

Russian culture is __imperialist__, __elitist__ and __chauvinistic__.
It's richness comes from the <span class="bloody">__blood__</span> of the colonized people.

- The "father of the modern Russian language", [__Pushkin__](/pushkin/), approved the colonisation of
  [Crimean Tatars](/pushkin/#approved-crimean-tatars-genocide-claimed-disarming-circassians-was-the-only-option-to-pacify-them-after-the-violent-conquest),
  [Circassians](/pushkin/#was-hoping-to-pacify-circassians-economically-by-blocking-their-access-to-the-black-sea),
  and
  [Ossetians](/pushkin/#approved-prostitution-among-poor-ossetian-women).

- The "Poet of the Caucasus", or "Russiaâ€™s Second Poet", [__Lermontov__](/lermontov/), was a soldier himself,
  and described [atrocities](/lermontov/#hussars-ignore-tears-and-prayers-and-brutally-traumatize-the-victim-because-of-an-arousal)
  that accompanied these conquests.

- The "empathetic examiner of the human soul", [__Dostoevsky__](/dostoevsky/), openly despised
  [Ukrainians](/dostoevsky/#despised-ukrainians-being-liberal-and-respecting-womens-rights-claimed-russian-patriarchy-to-be-natural),
  [Jews](/dostoevsky/#used-antisemitic-slurs-despised-jews-for-not-being-christians),
  [Poles](/dostoevsky/#claimed-poles-to-be-hostile-and-ultra-nationalist),
  [Austrians](/dostoevsky/#called-old-poles-and-austrians-scum-claimed-them-to-be-unworthy-of-russian-sympathy)
  and
  [Serbs](/dostoevsky/#claimed-russians-to-be-superior-and-colonized-nations-to-be-inferior-and-harmful).

- The "visionary critic of Soviet society", [__Bulgakov__](/bulgakov/), was born and lived in Kyiv, yet mocked
  [Kyivians](/bulgakov/#viewed-kyiv-as-inferior-to-moscow),
  [Ukrainian language](/bulgakov/#mocked-ukrainian-language-and-didnt-take-it-seriously)
  and
  [Ukrainian speakers](/bulgakov/#mocked-people-who-switched-to-ukrainian-implying-russian-language-and-resources-are-richer).

- The "Russian opposition leader", [__Navalny__](/navalny/), supported
  [Crimea annexation](/navalny/#supported-crimea-annexation-by-russia)
  and despised [Crimean Tatars](/navalny/#referred-to-indigenous-crimean-tatars-as-agitating-interested-parties).

  His widow, the "New face of Russian opposition", __Yulia Navalnaya__ supports
  [Russian colonialism](/navalny/#yulia-navalnaya-wishes-to-punish-the-opponents-of-russian-colonialism).
